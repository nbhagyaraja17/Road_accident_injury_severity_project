# Predicting and Analysis of Injury Severity of Road accidents
Implemented several Machine learning classification algorithms on London Road accidents pedestrian data.

Pre-processed and applied algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, XGBoost on the data.

Improved accuracy by 3% with Random Forest against all other classification algorithm.
